# We weren't ready for the hacathon
In the beginning we decided to solve 2nd problem, but we didnt and switched to 3rd. And we couldnt find an endpoints to parse data for monitoring. Than, we quit.

We made a **parser**. And separete front to our planned project, you may check if you want.


P.S. for parser you must install libraries aiohttp, bs4, fake_useragent, asyncio
